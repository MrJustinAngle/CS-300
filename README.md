# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 - The problem I was solving was creating an advising assistance software. This was to help ensure that the student had the correct prerequisites for the courses they want to register for. This would help the advisors and students to see what courses they would need to take.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
 - I approached the problem by making a flow chart of what I wanted this program to do. From there, I wrote pseudocode to make the vision a bit more seeable, I then started coding the program and did some debugging.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
 - I ran into a few problems of where to place the text file for the program to be able to read it. To fix this, I was able to do a google search to put it in the correct directory.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
 - Before this course, I did not have any coding experience in C++. I still feel very uncomfortable with C++ as this course was more focused on the data structures. But I feel comfortable with basic C++ coding. I think this course showed me there are many ways to code a program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 - My work on this project showed me that we need to ensure our code is understandable and not convoluted. It needs to be able to be updated by future people and to be able to do that it needs to meet industry standards.
